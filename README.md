# Python Calculator

This is a simple calculator by using PyScript to be able to write Python code on the web browser.

## Technologies

Project was created with:

- Python
- PyScript
- JavaScript
- HTML/CSS

Python was used to take all the inputs from the calculator buttons, calculate on the python file and return output value on the web browser.
JavaScrip was used to toggle between dark and light mode. To toggle between light and dark mode, click on the small circle on top of the calculator.

Still a lot of room for improvement and posibilities for updating the calculator with different styling and other features like percentage and scientific calculations.

### Important

PyScript is still on its develomental stages. It is still a little slow over all. Mostly slow on start up. Wanted to experiment with PyScript and see how it can work on the web browser. There was a lot of reading of the PyScript documentaton and looking at the examples to try to figure out how to able to take the input from the button and give an output on the web browser.
